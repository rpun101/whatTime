### What time ###
I like having a clock run in one tab! Searching in the web didn't yield to my satisfaction. So, I created this simple looking clock.  

Maybe, in future, I might add some timer feature and play with the background. But for now, this does the trick!

## Todo Tasks ##
+ [ ] Page title with timer
+ [ ] Add full-screen button

## Known Bug ##
1. date and day, does not change automatically, have to refresh page!
    + I didn't want this value to refresh every second!



### Thank you ###
